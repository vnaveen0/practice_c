       from the expression &j. C++ being more type restrictive, will not 
       allow implicit down qualification. However, C++ allows implicit 
       up qualification. The reason being, const qualified identifiers 
       are bound to be placed in read-only memory (but not always). If 
       C++ allows above kind of assignment (ptr = &j), we can use 'ptr' 
       to modify value of j which is in read-only memory. The 
       consequences are implementation dependent, the program may fail 
       at runtime. So strict type checking helps clean code. */
